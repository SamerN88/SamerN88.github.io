                    <p>
                        Software engineer, mathematician, outdoorsman, piano player, oud player, former martial artist, trilinguist, and neophyte woodworker.<br><br>
                        
                        I come from a strong mathematics background (huge math nerd) and am pursuing a career in software engineering, with a long-term goal 
                        of moving toward AI. When I'm not on the job, I thoroughly enjoy playing music and engaging in outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, and 
                        fishing. In life I strive to combine my passions; I'm currently working on a project where I apply calculus and numerical methods to model 
                        the oud, using software engineering to create a more efficient way to build the instrument. I'm testing my method by actually 
                        building it â€” hence "neophyte woodworker".<br><br>

                        What you see in the background is Qadisha Valley, in my beloved home country of Lebanon.



                        <!-- I'm a talented programmer with a <i>huge</i> passion for math and computer science. I spend my free time working on personal programming 
                        projects, which include a symmetric key encryption system, a working collection of numerical analysis implementations, a private website for me 
                        and my friends' music, a mathematical exploration of a particular prime number generator, and more. At any point in time, I have at least 
                        one programming project in the works. But beyond the tech stuff, I'm a highly active person in life. My favorite activities outside of my laptop 
                        screen include powerlifting, spearfishing, and skiing. As I was born in Norway, I've been skiing since I was 2 years old and I try to ski 
                        at least once a year. I've dabbled in boxing and jiu jitsu, and in high school I was the president of the Boxing and 
                        MMA Club. Besides math and computer science, my other passion is fitness. -->
                        <!-- <br><br>
                        As a math major, I once confused my friends when, 
                        after someone did a magic card trick, I got a pen and paper and started proving mathematically proving why the trick works 
                        every time. It turned out to be harder than I thought, so I went home and spent the next few weeks trying to prove it, 
                        drawing on my knowledge of number theory and real analysis, just so I can say I have mathematically 
                        proven that the card trick works every time. Now we know for sure. -->

                    <h4>My technical journey</h4>
                    <p>
                        During my sophomore year as an undergrad, I spent a couple of months fervently teaching myself JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB. 
                        Just seven months after I started programming, I was employed by Komak Solutions, a tech consulting firm in Texas, where I worked 
                        as a freelance full-stack developer for six months. It was my first taste of the tech industry, and I loved it.
                        <br><br>
                        This thirst for knowledge continued into my junior year when I signed up for a data science boot camp with General Assembly. This 
                        10-week intensive course equipped me with strong data science skills in Python and statistics. My final project was an analysis of 
                        7000 foreclosed properties, where I built a data model to predict the profitability of property flips. The instructors even 
                        suggested that I could work as an instructor for General Assembly.
                        <br><br>
                        Later, I applied my data science knowledge to an independent project where I analyzed ECG data from over 10,000 patients, building 
                        machine learning models to diagnose heart conditions. These experiences solidified my passion for data science and machine learning.
                        <br><br>
                        Most recently, I worked as an Associate Security Software Engineer at Indeed for about 2 years, where I gained some great experience 
                        in IAM and learned a lot of the industry's technologies. I aim to expand my skillset in various areas, including devops, machine 
                        learning, and general industry expertise. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at UT Austin, with 
                        a long-term goal of advancing in the AI field.

                        consistently rewarded for exceeding expectations of quality and efficiency, and was noted by my employer as having an extraordinary

                                            In this independent analysis of ECG data from over 10,000 patients, I built multiple ML models that diagnose various heart conditions. 
                                            The classifiers I used were KNN, decision trees, and logistic regression. My best model was a decision tree that can diagnose a patient 
                                            with an abnormal heart rhythm, with an accuracy of 94% and a recall score of 0.93.

                                            For the final project in my Deep Learning graduate course, my group and I trained a neural network in 
                                            SuperTuxKart Ice-Hockey using DAgger imitation learning, creating an AI that competes with other agents. 
                                            Future enhancements may incorporate reinforcement learning to improve strategies. This project highlights 
                                            the transformative potential of machine learning in gaming.
